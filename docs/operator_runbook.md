# Operator Runbook

## Scope

This runbook covers the live execution path in `BinanceQuant`.

Primary entrypoints:

- `main.py` for live hourly execution
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` for self-hosted manual/API-triggered runs
- `run_cycle_replay.py` for fixed-input dry-run replay

Supporting modules with operational impact:

- `runtime_config_support.py` for runtime env parsing and bootstrap
- `degraded_mode_support.py` for trend-pool fallback ladder and source metadata
- `trend_pool_support.py` for upstream payload validation
- `live_services.py` for Firestore and Telegram adapters

## Execution Boundary

`BinanceQuant` is the downstream execution engine.

It is responsible for:

- consuming upstream live-pool artifacts and Firestore summary payloads
- validating freshness, contract shape, and fallback eligibility
- executing orders, persisting runtime state, and emitting minimal operator alerts

It is not responsible for:

- monthly research reporting
- upstream release summaries or review packages
- maintaining a second copy of the upstream publish narrative

## Normal Live Flow

1. Load runtime credentials and Firestore state.
2. Resolve the upstream trend pool in this order:
   - fresh upstream Firestore payload
   - last known good upstream payload from state
   - validated local upstream file fallback
   - built-in static universe as last resort
3. Refresh trend-pool metadata in state.
4. Capture Binance balances and market snapshots.
5. Run trend rotation, BTC DCA, and earn-buffer maintenance.
6. Persist updated state and notifications.

Runtime output should stay operational:

- current upstream source and degraded status
- upstream official pool and current local execution pool logged as separate concepts
- current execution targets and intents
- exceptions, circuit breakers, and alert-worthy failures

## Runtime Trigger Model

- `main.yml` is `workflow_dispatch` only.
- GitHub Actions no longer owns the hourly cadence for runtime execution in this repo.
- Production cadence should come from one external scheduler, for example VPS cron calling the GitHub Actions dispatch API.
- Avoid overlapping dispatches from multiple schedulers or from a second manual run while the current runtime job is still in progress.

## Degraded Mode Ladder

Healthy mode:

- Source is `fresh_upstream`
- New trend entries are allowed
- Monthly pool refresh is allowed

Degraded mode:

- Source is `last_known_good`, `local_file`, or `static`
- New trend buys are paused by default
- Set `TREND_POOL_ALLOW_NEW_ENTRIES_ON_DEGRADED=1` only if you intentionally want degraded-mode entries

Interpretation:

- `last_known_good` means fresh upstream validation failed, but a previously accepted upstream payload is still available in state
- `local_file` means upstream live access failed and the runtime fell back to a validated local file from CryptoLeaderRotation
- `static` is emergency-only and should be treated as lowest-confidence operation

## Runtime Expectations By Failure Type

### Upstream stale or malformed

Expected behavior:

- Runtime does not silently treat stale upstream as healthy
- Falls back to last known good, then local file, then static universe
- State keeps source metadata so the degraded source is visible in audit trails

Operator action:

- Inspect upstream Firestore payload freshness and shape
- Verify the upstream project published the expected `version`, `mode`, and `pool_size`
- Prefer fixing upstream rather than enabling degraded new entries

### Firestore unavailable

Expected behavior:

- If state load fails, the cycle aborts before trading
- If trend-pool Firestore read fails but state load works, runtime can still fall back to last known good / local file / static

Operator action:

- Validate `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or workflow secret `GCP_SA_KEY`
- Check service account validity and Firestore API availability
- Use `run_cycle_replay.py` for dry-run confirmation while Firestore is unavailable

### Binance API failure

Expected behavior:

- Client bootstrap retries before aborting
- If connection cannot be established, cycle exits with an error notification and no trades

Operator action:

- Check Binance API key validity, IP restrictions, and runner connectivity
- Re-run manually only after the connectivity issue is confirmed resolved

### Telegram unavailable

Expected behavior:

- Telegram send failures should not stop the trading cycle
- The cycle may still finish while alert delivery is degraded

Operator action:

- Verify `TG_TOKEN` / `TG_CHAT_ID`
- Treat this as an observability incident, not a trading-signal incident

## Local Operator Commands

Preferred local install path:

```bash
cd /path/to/BinanceQuant
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
REQ_FILE="requirements-lock.txt"
if [ ! -f "$REQ_FILE" ]; then REQ_FILE="requirements.txt"; fi
pip install -r "$REQ_FILE"
```

Replay one fixed cycle:

```bash
python3 run_cycle_replay.py --run-id local-check
```

Run unit tests:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Workflow Secret Hygiene

- The GitHub Actions workflow now writes `GCP_SA_KEY` into a temp file inside the execution step only.
- The temp credential path is exported as `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` only for that step.
- A shell `trap` removes the file on exit, including failure paths.

## Escalation Guidelines

- If the runtime falls to `static`, treat it as an operator-visible degraded incident.
- If Firestore state cannot load, do not bypass the abort by force-running live trades.
- If upstream remains stale for multiple cycles, coordinate with the upstream publisher before changing degraded-mode buy policy.
